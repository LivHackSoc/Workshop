Go is an open source programming language created by Google in 2009. The main team consists of people who was part of the C programming language and Unix development. Positive aspect of Go includes:

* Syntex combines the best of many languages include C, Python and JavaScript
* Statically typed (includes memory safety, garbage collection and more)
* Extremely fast to build. Very efficient compiler
* Takes advantages of multiple core, hence it is popular for concurrent programming
* Does not include many boilerplate (e.g. Java)

### Main

Always include the package main at the start. The main() function is the entry point of the program. For example you want to call functions inside this. It is similar to Java's main method.
